What is DOCTYPE declaration in HTML?

--> The DOCTYPE declaration looks something like a tag. But it can't be called a tag because it doesn't format any content or text. It just provides an information to the browser about what kind of document to expect.

Also to be noted, the DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive. <!DOCTYPE html> <!DocTYPE html>
